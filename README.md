# ReactAWSGraphQLAPI

An early experiment in the use of AWS Amplify with GraphQL and React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get this up and running, ensure you have AWS Amplify CLI, and then follow these steps:

1) cd ReactAWSGraphQLAPI
2) npm install
3) npm start
